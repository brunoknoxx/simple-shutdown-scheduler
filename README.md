                               This is the simple shutdown scheduler by Bruno Knoxx
                                       [https://github.com/brunoknoxx]

                            This script uses the "shutdown" program as its base.
                           The shutdown program does not allow you to set the amount
                            of time in days, hours, or minutes, only in seconds.
                            If you downloaded this script, you must be familiar with
                                             the shutdown command.
                            This script converts and makes it easy to use days, hours
                            and minutes as units in the shutdown command. This way
                            you don't need to use calc or google to convert the
                            value you want to use, and then manually type it in a
                                                    command.
                            Using this script, you don't need to type anything but
                             numbers on the UI. After confirm your action, you will
                            see a message with the information you typed, and then
                                  the program will start the action and exit.

                                 You can also put this file inside C:\Windows\
                             to call it directly, without having to "cd" before call
                                   "easyscheduler" in the command prompt.

                             Otherwise, just double-click the file if you don't want
                                                 to use CMD.
